This is a project that I practiced with FastAPI. I created a simple application that performs a few tasks:

1- A function that views the current list.
2- A function that includes a new video game to the list
3- A user can update the list of video games
4- A user can delete a video game from the list. 

If you want to test this code, you have to install FastAPI and uvicorn on your device.
A- pip install fastapi
B- pip install uvicorn
C- uvicorn main:app --reload
